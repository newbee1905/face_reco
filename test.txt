Hey everyone today, we are presenting our project from team i71CuponZ for our client satyshake. Introducing our team members who have worked really hard for this project. Our client wanted a coupon generator website which would include coupons deals by registered business owners.
We are building an e-commerce solution that not only help businesses to attract buyers also one platform for consumers to get offers and discounts instead of browsing one hundreds of websites. We have Jack here, he is opening a new clothing store and he is worried how he will attract customers. So we have a solution for him, now Jack can create membership on our website with amazing discounts as a seller and people can buy those coupons and use in his store.
He even doesn't need to worry about marketing costs too for advertisements on social media ads as his consumers with his offers on our platform. Our next users are shoppers who are looking for best deals. Meet Sarah, she loves to shop but in this economy it is hard to buy in budget.
So she has to browse so many platforms to find sales and has to subscribe to hundreds of store emails to find the best deals. But she has CuponZ website now she only needs to select the categories of the product and she can see all the available discounts. Here is the design of our website.
This is the home page featuring the best deals and showing coupons from different sellers and brands. This is the CuponZ page illustrating coupons for different companies. There is a filter option to select by type, brand and dates.
Our front-end technologies include HTML for the structure, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap and React. JS, a powerful JavaScript library for design and functionalities. For the back-end of our web application, we'll employ Express, JS, Fastify and Koa as our primary node.
JS frameworks, each offering unique advantages in terms of flexibility, performance and code readability. These frameworks will handle HTTP requests, facilitate API development and ensure smooth operation of our application. We have completed our design and now we are confident that we will complete the implementation part of the website next semester.
You can be like Jack and Sarah and use our platform to get the best coupons for the deals. We will be back end of this year with our CuponZ platform so stay tuned.
